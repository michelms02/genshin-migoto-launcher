# Genshin Impact + 3DMigoto Launcher
This Python script has been written for my own necessities and personal use. I added Genshin Impact as a non-steam game because I like having the in-game status on the platform whenever I'm playing something, however, I find it inconvenient to launch both Genshin and 3DMigoto separately every time, thus I came up with this very basic script.

# Usage
- Make sure you have Python installed
- Configure your own path for both 3DMigoto and Genshin Impact
- Change the arguments for launching Genshin as you see fit
- _Optional: Create an executable of the Python script with [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)_

# Notes
- I may or may not put further work on this in the future in case I decide to start using FPS unlocker. As previously mentioned, the script is pretty basic and straightforward, intended for personal use
- It goes without saying that using this as well as any other third-party tool along with Genshin Impact means you are doing it at your own risk
